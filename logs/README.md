# Mohi Lab MDS Project
This repository is for running the long read proteogenomics pipeline on mouse data from the Mohi Lab. The dataset is PacBio sequence data from 3 wild type mice and 3 mutant mice. Those data live in `/project/sheynkma/raw_data/PacBio/mohi_data`. I am running this pipeline on the UVA Rivanna cluster. <br />

The PacBio data came with pre-processing (IsoSeq through pigeon).
